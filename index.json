However, this often leads to a phenomenon known as loss of plasticity, where the network loses its ability to learn new information and thereby shows worse generalization performance than those trained from scratch. While this issue has been actively studied in non-stationary data distributions, it surprisingly occurs even when the data distribution remains stationary, and its underlying mechanism is poorly understood. To address this gap, we develop a framework emulating real-world neural network training. Under this framework, we identify noise memorization as the primary cause of plasticity loss when warm-starting networks on stationary data. Motivated by this discovery, we propose Direction-Aware SHrinking (DASH), an effective method aiming to mitigate plasticity loss by selectively forgetting memorized noise while preserving learned features. We validate our approach on vision classification task, demonstrating consistent improvements in test accuracy and training efficiency.","tags":[],"title":"DASH: Warm-Starting Neural Network Training Without Loss of Plasticity Under Stationarity","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1718755200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718755200,"objectID":"f1693c26feab3bae7614998c4c0eb7bf","permalink":"https://chulheeyun.github.io/news/17/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/17/","section":"news","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"One paper got accepted to the ICML 2024 Workshop on \u003ca href=\"https://longcontextfm.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLong-Context Foundation Models\u003c/a\u003e and another paper to appear at the ICML 2024 Workshop on \u003ca href=\"https://want-ai-hpc.github.io/icml2024/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAdvancing Neural Network Training: Computational Efficiency, Scalability, and Resource Optimization\u003c/a\u003e.","type":"news"},{"authors":["Junsoo Oh","Chulhee Yun"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1718582520,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718582520,"objectID":"f2c5dbaa605794c20b8b7151bd99dfd0","permalink":"https://chulheeyun.github.io/publication/oh2024provable/","publishdate":"2023-10-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/oh2024provable/","section":"publication","summary":"Patch-level data augmentation techniques such as Cutout and CutMix have demonstrated significant efficacy in enhancing the performance of image-based tasks. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of these methods remains elusive. In this paper, we study two-layer neural networks trained using three distinct methods: vanilla training without augmentation, Cutout training, and CutMix training. Our analysis focuses on a feature-noise data model, which consists of several label-dependent features of varying rarity and label-independent noises of differing strengths. Our theorems demonstrate that Cutout training can learn features with low frequencies that vanilla training cannot, while CutMix training can even learn rarer features that Cutout cannot capture. From this, we establish that CutMix yields the highest test accuracy among the three. Our novel analysis reveals that CutMix training makes the network learn all features and noise vectors ‚Äúevenly‚Äù regardless of the rarity and strength, which provides an interesting insight into understanding patch-level augmentation.","tags":[],"title":"Provable Benefit of Cutout and CutMix for Feature Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1718582400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718582400,"objectID":"841d216a7ab752cf09babd560d5e80bc","permalink":"https://chulheeyun.github.io/news/16/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/16/","section":"news","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Three papers got accepted to the ICML 2024 Workshop on \u003ca href=\"https://sites.google.com/corp/view/hidimlearning/home\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHigh-dimensional Learning Dynamics 2024: The Emergence of Structure and Reasoning\u003c/a\u003e.","type":"news"},{"authors":["Hanseul Cho","Jaeyoung Cha","Pranjal Awasthi","Srinadh Bhojanapalli","Anupam Gupta","Chulhee Yun"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1717113600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1717113600,"objectID":"21849ca8369ee8a82067f992c8285ec2","permalink":"https://chulheeyun.github.io/publication/cho2024position/","publishdate":"2023-10-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cho2024position/","section":"publication","summary":"Even for simple arithmetic tasks like integer addition, it is challenging for Transformers to generalize to longer sequences than those encountered during training. To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more ‚Äúrelevant‚Äù tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.","tags":[],"title":"Position Coupling: Leveraging Task Structure for Improved Length Generalization of Transformers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Minhak Song","Kwangjun Ahn","Chulhee Yun"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1716595200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1716595200,"objectID":"2ef78072cc8f25f084f8491336d2a8eb","permalink":"https://chulheeyun.github.io/publication/song2024does/","publishdate":"2023-10-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/song2024does/","section":"publication","summary":"Understanding the training dynamics of deep neural networks is challenging due to their high-dimensional nature and intricate loss landscapes. Recent studies have revealed that, along the training trajectory, the gradient approximately aligns with a low-rank top eigenspace of the training loss Hessian, referred to as the dominant subspace. Given this alignment, this paper explores whether neural networks can be trained within the dominant subspace, which, if feasible, could lead to more efficient training methods. Our primary observation is that when the SGD update is projected onto the dominant subspace, the training loss does not decrease further. This suggests that the observed alignment between the gradient and the dominant subspace is spurious. Surprisingly, projecting out the dominant subspace proves to be just as effective as the original update, despite removing the majority of the original update component. Similar observations are made for the large learning rate regime (also known as Edge of Stability) and Sharpness-Aware Minimization. We discuss the main causes and implications of this spurious alignment, shedding light on the intricate dynamics of neural network training.","tags":[],"title":"Does SGD really happen in tiny subspaces?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Prin Phunyaphibarn","Junghyun Lee","Bohan Wang","Huishuai Zhang","Chulhee Yun"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1716508800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1716508800,"objectID":"200a5b9ea65d0b341b7b0ce92e961f56","permalink":"https://chulheeyun.github.io/publication/phunyaphibarn2023large/","publishdate":"2023-10-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/phunyaphibarn2023large/","section":"publication","summary":"Although gradient descent with Polyak's momentum is widely used in modern machine and deep learning, a concrete understanding of its effects on the training trajectory remains elusive.

We hypothesize that the large catapult is caused by momentum ‚Äúprolonging‚Äù the self-stabilization effect (Damian et al., 2023).

While Alt-GDA is commonly observed to converge faster, the performance gap between the two is not yet well understood theoretically, especially in terms of global convergence rates. To address this theory-practice gap, we present fine-grained convergence analyses of both algorithms for strongly-convex-strongly-concave and Lipschitz-gradient objectives. Our new iteration complexity upper bound of Alt-GDA is strictly smaller than the lower bound of Sim-GDA; i.e., Alt-GDA is provably faster. Moreover, we propose Alternating-Extrapolation GDA (Alex-GDA), a general algorithmic framework that subsumes Sim-GDA and Alt-GDA, for which the main idea is to alternately take gradients from extrapolations of the iterates. We show that Alex-GDA satisfies a smaller iteration complexity bound, identical to that of the Extra-gradient method, while requiring less gradient computations. We also prove that Alex-GDA enjoys linear convergence for bilinear problems, for which both Sim-GDA and Alt-GDA fail to converge at all.","tags":[],"title":"Fundamental Benefit of Alternating Updates in Minimax Optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1705449600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1705449600,"objectID":"035d3f0988d2ede4e76fb13f79e2bf18","permalink":"https://chulheeyun.github.io/news/13/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/13/","section":"news","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Our \u003ca href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01082\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epaper\u003c/a\u003e on the optimization characteristics of linear Transformers got accepted to ICLR 2024!","type":"news"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1705017600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1705017600,"objectID":"8b09eac354cd8f66dba7200cb78ccc4e","permalink":"https://chulheeyun.github.io/news/12/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/12/","section":"news","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"I had the honor to take part in the Fifth Korean-American Kavli Frontiers of Science Symposium as a session speaker.","type":"news"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1698451200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1698451200,"objectID":"dec6fde4a8149f454f251d0d9272a4a0","permalink":"https://chulheeyun.github.io/news/11/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/11/","section":"news","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Two papers got accepted to the NeurIPS 2023 Workshop on \u003ca href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/m3l-2023\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMathematics of Modern Machine Learning (M3L)\u003c/a\u003e!

We make progress towards understanding the subtleties of training transformers by carefully studying a simple yet canonical linearized shallow transformer model. Specifically, we train linear transformers to solve regression tasks, inspired by J. von Oswald et al. (ICML 2023), and K. Ahn et al. (NeurIPS 2023). Most importantly, we observe that our proposed linearized models can reproduce several prominent aspects of transformer training dynamics. Consequently, the results obtained in this paper suggest that a simple linearized transformer model could actually be a valuable, realistic abstraction for understanding transformer optimization.","tags":[],"title":"Linear attention is (maybe) all you need (to understand transformer optimization)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Junghyun Lee","Hanseul Cho","Se-Young Yun","Chulhee Yun"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1695340800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1695340800,"objectID":"1e1602697ab2e90d560b085de9ce85ef","permalink":"https://chulheeyun.github.io/publication/lee2023fair/","publishdate":"2023-09-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lee2023fair/","section":"publication","summary":"Fair Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a problem setting where we aim to perform PCA while making the resulting representation fair in that the projected distributions, conditional on the sensitive attributes, match one another.

On the theoretical side, we rigorously formulate fair PCA using a new notion called *probably approximately fair and optimal* (PAFO) learnability. On the practical side, motivated by recent advances in streaming algorithms for addressing memory limitation, we propose a new setting called *fair streaming PCA* along with a memory-efficient algorithm, fair noisy power method (FNPM). We then provide its *statistical* guarantee in terms of PAFO-learnability, which is the first of its kind in fair PCA literature.

In this paper, we start by demonstrating through empirical studies that when the EoS phenomenon occurs, different GD trajectories (after a proper reparameterization) align on a specific bifurcation diagram independent of initialization. We then rigorously prove this trajectory alignment phenomenon for a two-layer fully-connected linear network and a single-neuron nonlinear network trained with a single data point.

In principle, off-policy RL algorithms can improve sample efficiency by allowing multiple updates per environment interaction. However, these multiple updates often lead the model to overfit to earlier interactions, which is referred to as the loss of plasticity. Our study investigates the underlying causes of this phenomenon by dividing plasticity into two aspects. Input plasticity, which denotes the model's adaptability to changing input data, and label plasticity, which denotes the model's adaptability to evolving input-output relationships. Synthetic experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset reveal that finding smoother minima of loss landscape enhances input plasticity, whereas refined gradient propagation improves label plasticity. Leveraging these findings, we introduce the PLASTIC algorithm, which harmoniously combines techniques to address both concerns. With minimal architectural modifications, PLASTIC achieves competitive performance on benchmarks including Atari-100k and Deepmind Control Suite. This result emphasizes the importance of preserving the model's plasticity to elevate the sample efficiency in RL.

Existing studies prove convergence of SAM for smooth functions, but they do so by assuming decaying perturbation size $\\rho$ and/or no gradient normalization in $y_t$, which is detached from practice. To address this gap, we study deterministic/stochastic versions of SAM with practical configurations (i.e., constant $\\rho$ and gradient normalization in $y_t$) and explore their convergence properties on smooth functions with (non)convexity assumptions. Perhaps surprisingly, in many scenarios, we find out that SAM has *limited* capability to converge to global minima or stationary points. For smooth strongly convex functions, we show that while deterministic SAM enjoys tight global convergence rates of $\\tilde \\Theta(\\frac{1}{T^2})$, the convergence bound of stochastic SAM suffers an *inevitable* additive term $\\mathcal O(\\rho^2)$, indicating convergence only up to *neighborhoods* of optima. In fact, such $\\mathcal O(\\rho^2)$ factors arise for stochastic SAM in all the settings we consider, and also for deterministic SAM in nonconvex cases; importantly, we prove by examples that such terms are *unavoidable*. Our results highlight vastly different characteristics of SAM with vs. without decaying perturbation size or gradient normalization, and suggest that the intuitions gained from one version may not apply to the other.","tags":[],"title":"Practical Sharpness-Aware Minimization Cannot Converge All the Way to Optima","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Junsoo Oh","Chulhee Yun"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1682380800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682380800,"objectID":"d3509dd8e14bebc35e402d65fe10d075","permalink":"https://chulheeyun.github.io/publication/oh2023provable/","publishdate":"2023-04-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/oh2023provable/","section":"publication","summary":"We investigate how pair-wise data augmentation techniques like Mixup affect the sample complexity of finding optimal decision boundaries in a binary linear classification problem.

As we increase $\\kappa$ to make the data distribution more separable, the sample complexity of vanilla training increases exponentially in $\\kappa$; perhaps surprisingly, the task of finding optimal decision boundaries becomes harder for more separable distributions. For Mixup training, we show that Mixup mitigates this problem by significantly reducing the sample complexity. To this end, we develop new concentration results applicable to $n^2$ pair-wise augmented data points constructed from $n$ independent data, by carefully dealing with dependencies between overlapping pairs.

Single-shuffle is a popular without-replacement sampling scheme that shuffles only once in the beginning, but has not been studied in the Recht-R√© conjecture and the follow-up literature. Instead of focusing on general positive semidefinite matrices, we restrict our attention to positive definite matrices with small enough condition numbers, which are more relevant to matrices that arise in the analysis of SGD. For such matrices, we conjecture that the means of matrix products satisfy a series of spectral norm inequalities that imply ‚Äúsingle-shuffle SGD converges faster than random-reshuffle SGD, which is in turn faster than with-replacement SGD and GD‚Äù in special cases.","tags":[],"title":"Open Problem: Can Single-Shuffle SGD be Better than Reshuffling SGD and GD?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sejun Park","Jaeho Lee","Chulhee Yun","Jinwoo Shin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1627776e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627776e3,"objectID":"866074fd759f8204c604ff589e704294","permalink":"https://chulheeyun.github.io/publication/park2021provable/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/park2021provable/","section":"publication","summary":"It is known that $O(N)$ parameters are sufficient for neural networks to memorize arbitrary $N$ input-label pairs.

With this formulation, we can characterize the convergence direction of the network parameters as singular vectors of a tensor defined by the network.

However, these models suffer from quadratic computational cost in the input sequence length $n$ to compute pairwise attention in each layer. This has prompted recent research into sparse Transformers that sparsify the connections in the attention layers. While empirically promising for long sequences, fundamental questions remain unanswered: Can sparse Transformers approximate any arbitrary sequence-to-sequence function, similar to their dense counterparts? How does the sparsity pattern and the sparsity level affect their performance? In this paper, we address these questions and provide a unifying framework that captures existing sparse attention models. We propose sufficient conditions under which we prove that a sparse attention model can universally approximate any sequence-to-sequence function. Surprisingly, our results show that sparse Transformers with only $O(n)$ connections per attention layer can approximate the same function class as the dense model with $n^2$ connections. Lastly, we present experiments comparing different patterns/levels of sparsity on standard NLP tasks.","tags":[],"title":"$O(n)$ Connections are Expressive Enough: Universal Approximability of Sparse Transformers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Srinadh Bhojanapalli","Chulhee Yun","Ankit Singh Rawat","Sashank J.

In addition to new pre-training techniques, recent improvements crucially rely on working with a relatively larger embedding dimension for tokens. Unfortunately, this leads to models that are prohibitively large to be employed in the downstream tasks. In this paper we identify one of the important factors contributing to the large embedding size requirement. In particular, our analysis highlights that the scaling between the number of heads and the size of each head in the current architecture gives rise to a low-rank bottleneck in attention heads, causing this limitation. We further validate this in our experiments. As a solution we propose to set the head size of an attention unit to input sequence length, and independent of the number of heads, resulting in multi-head attention layers with provably more expressive power. We empirically show that this allows us to train models with a relatively smaller embedding dimension and with better performance scaling.","tags":[],"title":"Low-Rank Bottleneck in Multi-head Attention Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chulhee Yun","Srinadh Bhojanapalli","Ankit Singh Rawat","Sashank J.

In this paper, we establish that Transformer models are universal approximators of continuous permutation equivariant sequence-to-sequence functions with compact support, which is quite surprising given the amount of shared parameters in these models. Furthermore, using positional encodings, we circumvent the restriction of permutation equivariance, and show that Transformer models can universally approximate arbitrary continuous sequence-to-sequence functions on a compact domain. Interestingly, our proof techniques clearly highlight the different roles of the self-attention and the feed-forward layers in Transformers. In particular, we prove that fixed width self-attention layers can compute contextual mappings of the input sequences, playing a key role in the universal approximation property of Transformers. Based on this insight from our analysis, we consider other simpler alternatives to self-attention layers and empirically evaluate them.","tags":[],"title":"Are Transformers universal approximators of sequence-to-sequence functions?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chulhee Yun","Suvrit Sra","Ali Jadbabaie"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575244800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575244800,"objectID":"1dca91c1d1da285dbdec8f5124c7f935","permalink":"https://chulheeyun.github.io/publication/yun2019deep/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yun2019deep/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent results in the literature indicate that a residual network (ResNet) composed of a single residual block outperforms linear predictors, in the sense that all local minima in its optimization landscape are at least as good as the best linear predictor. However, these results are limited to a single residual block (i.e., shallow ResNets), instead of the deep ResNets composed of multiple residual blocks. We take a step towards extending this result to deep ResNets. We start by two motivating examples. First, we show that there exist datasets for which all local minima of a fully-connected ReLU network are no better than the best linear predictor, whereas a ResNet has strictly better local minima. Second, we show that even at the global minimum, the representation obtained from the residual block outputs of a 2-block ResNet do not necessarily improve monotonically over subsequent blocks, which highlights a fundamental difficulty in analyzing deep ResNets. Our main theorem on deep ResNets shows under simple geometric conditions that, any critical point in the optimization landscape is either (i) at least as good as the best linear predictor; or (ii) the Hessian at this critical point has a strictly negative eigenvalue. Notably, our theorem shows that a chain of multiple skip-connections can improve the optimization landscape, whereas existing results study direct skip-connections to the last hidden layer or output layer. Finally, we complement our results by showing benign properties of the ‚Äúnear-identity regions‚Äù of deep ResNets, showing depth-independent upper bounds for the risk attained at critical points as well as the Rademacher complexity.","tags":[],"title":"Are deep ResNets provably better than linear predictors?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chulhee Yun","Suvrit Sra","Ali Jadbabaie"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575158400,"objectID":"7b0e84861db5637939c7e6c71f083eb5","permalink":"https://chulheeyun.github.io/publication/yun2019small2/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yun2019small2/","section":"publication","summary":"We study finite sample expressivity, i.e., memorization power of ReLU networks.

We also prove that width $\\Theta(\\sqrt N)$ is necessary and sufficient for memorizing $N$ data points, proving tight bounds on memorization capacity. The sufficiency result can be extended to deeper networks; we show that an $L$-layer network with $W$ parameters in the hidden layers can memorize $N$ data points if $W = \\Omega(N)$. Combined with a recent upper bound $O(W L \\log W)$ on VC dimension, our construction is nearly tight for any fixed $L$. Subsequently, we analyze memorization capacity of residual networks under a general position assumption; we prove results that substantially reduce the known requirement of $N$ hidden nodes.

By exploiting polyhedral geometry, we reduce the total computation down to one convex quadratic program (QP) for each hidden node, $O(M)$ (in)equality tests, and one (or a few) nonconvex QP.

Starting with the most discriminative BLPF selected, the LHP generating algorithm iteratively updates the bits of the selected BLPF by replacing the least discriminative bit with the most discriminative bit of all the candidate BLPFs. At the expense of a small increase in computation, the LHP is guaranteed to give smaller or equal empirical error compared to any BLPFs considered in the pool. Experimental comparison of different sets of features consistently shows that the LHP leads to better performance than previously proposed methods under the AdaBoost face detection framework on MIT+CMU and FDDB benchmark datasets.","tags":[],"title":"Face detection using Local Hybrid Patterns","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://chulheeyun.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
