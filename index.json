Most practical implementations of SGDA randomly reshuffle components and sequentially use them (i.e., without-replacement sampling); however, there are few theoretical results on this approach for minimax algorithms, especially outside the easier-to-analyze (strongly-)monotone setups. To narrow this gap, we study the convergence bounds of SGDA with random reshuffling (SGDA-RR) for smooth nonconvex-nonconcave objectives with Polyak-≈Åojasiewicz (P≈Å) geometry. We analyze both simultaneous and alternating SGDA-RR for nonconvex-P≈Å and primal-P≈Å-P≈Å objectives, and obtain convergence rates faster than with-replacement SGDA. Our rates also extend to mini-batch SGDA-RR, recovering known rates for full-batch gradient descent-ascent (GDA). Lastly, we present a comprehensive lower bound for two-time-scale GDA, which matches the full-batch rate for primal-P≈Å-P≈Å case.","tags":[],"title":"SGDA with shuffling: faster convergence for nonconvex-P≈Å minimax optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1650499200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1650499200,"objectID":"3143885e38749fbef1f8571df4cb4631","permalink":"https://chulheeyun.github.io/news/3/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/3/","section":"news","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"I had an \u003ca href=\"https://www.eiric.or.kr/manpower/rising_view.php?Seq=43\" target=\"_blank\"\u003einterview\u003c/a\u003e (in Korean) with the Electronic \u0026 Information Research Information Center (EIRIC).

Most existing analyses of these methods assume independent and unbiased gradient estimates obtained via with-replacement sampling. In contrast, we study shuffling-based variants: minibatch and local Random Reshuffling, which draw stochastic gradients without replacement and are thus closer to practice. For smooth functions satisfying the Polyak-≈Åojasiewicz condition, we obtain convergence bounds (in the large epoch regime) which show that these shuffling-based variants converge faster than their with-replacement counterparts. Moreover, we prove matching lower bounds showing that our convergence analysis is tight.

Instead of focusing on general positive semidefinite matrices, we restrict our attention to positive definite matrices with small enough condition numbers, which are more relevant to matrices that arise in the analysis of SGD.

We propose a tensor formulation of neural networks that includes fully-connected, diagonal, and convolutional networks as special cases, and investigate the linear version of the formulation called linear tensor networks. With this formulation, we can characterize the convergence direction of the network parameters as singular vectors of a tensor defined by the network. For $L$-layer linear tensor networks that are orthogonally decomposable, we show that gradient flow on separable classification finds a stationary point of the $\\ell_{2/L}$ max-margin problem in a ‚Äútransformed‚Äù input space defined by the network. For underdetermined regression, we prove that gradient flow finds a global minimum which minimizes a norm-like function that interpolates between weighted $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ norms in the transformed input space. Our theorems subsume existing results in the literature while removing standard convergence assumptions.

We also prove that the same conclusion does not hold for the uniform approximation with ReLU, but does hold with an additional threshold activation function.

However, these models suffer from quadratic computational cost in the input sequence length $n$ to compute pairwise attention in each layer. This has prompted recent research into sparse Transformers that sparsify the connections in the attention layers. While empirically promising for long sequences, fundamental questions remain unanswered: Can sparse Transformers approximate any arbitrary sequence-to-sequence function, similar to their dense counterparts? How does the sparsity pattern and the sparsity level affect their performance? In this paper, we address these questions and provide a unifying framework that captures existing sparse attention models. We propose sufficient conditions under which we prove that a sparse attention model can universally approximate any sequence-to-sequence function. Surprisingly, our results show that sparse Transformers with only $O(n)$ connections per attention layer can approximate the same function class as the dense model with $n^2$ connections. Lastly, we present experiments comparing different patterns/levels of sparsity on standard NLP tasks.","tags":[],"title":"$O(n)$ Connections are Expressive Enough: Universal Approximability of Sparse Transformers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Srinadh Bhojanapalli","Chulhee Yun","Ankit Singh Rawat","Sashank J.

In addition to new pre-training techniques, recent improvements crucially rely on working with a relatively larger embedding dimension for tokens. Unfortunately, this leads to models that are prohibitively large to be employed in the downstream tasks. In this paper we identify one of the important factors contributing to the large embedding size requirement. In particular, our analysis highlights that the scaling between the number of heads and the size of each head in the current architecture gives rise to a low-rank bottleneck in attention heads, causing this limitation. We further validate this in our experiments. As a solution we propose to set the head size of an attention unit to input sequence length, and independent of the number of heads, resulting in multi-head attention layers with provably more expressive power. We empirically show that this allows us to train models with a relatively smaller embedding dimension and with better performance scaling.","tags":[],"title":"Low-Rank Bottleneck in Multi-head Attention Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chulhee Yun","Srinadh Bhojanapalli","Ankit Singh Rawat","Sashank J.

In this paper, we establish that Transformer models are universal approximators of continuous permutation equivariant sequence-to-sequence functions with compact support, which is quite surprising given the amount of shared parameters in these models. Furthermore, using positional encodings, we circumvent the restriction of permutation equivariance, and show that Transformer models can universally approximate arbitrary continuous sequence-to-sequence functions on a compact domain. Interestingly, our proof techniques clearly highlight the different roles of the self-attention and the feed-forward layers in Transformers. In particular, we prove that fixed width self-attention layers can compute contextual mappings of the input sequences, playing a key role in the universal approximation property of Transformers. Based on this insight from our analysis, we consider other simpler alternatives to self-attention layers and empirically evaluate them.","tags":[],"title":"Are Transformers universal approximators of sequence-to-sequence functions?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chulhee Yun","Suvrit Sra","Ali Jadbabaie"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575244800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575244800,"objectID":"1dca91c1d1da285dbdec8f5124c7f935","permalink":"https://chulheeyun.github.io/publication/yun2019deep/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yun2019deep/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent results in the literature indicate that a residual network (ResNet) composed of a single residual block outperforms linear predictors, in the sense that all local minima in its optimization landscape are at least as good as the best linear predictor. However, these results are limited to a single residual block (i.e., shallow ResNets), instead of the deep ResNets composed of multiple residual blocks. We take a step towards extending this result to deep ResNets. We start by two motivating examples. First, we show that there exist datasets for which all local minima of a fully-connected ReLU network are no better than the best linear predictor, whereas a ResNet has strictly better local minima. Second, we show that even at the global minimum, the representation obtained from the residual block outputs of a 2-block ResNet do not necessarily improve monotonically over subsequent blocks, which highlights a fundamental difficulty in analyzing deep ResNets. Our main theorem on deep ResNets shows under simple geometric conditions that, any critical point in the optimization landscape is either (i) at least as good as the best linear predictor; or (ii) the Hessian at this critical point has a strictly negative eigenvalue. Notably, our theorem shows that a chain of multiple skip-connections can improve the optimization landscape, whereas existing results study direct skip-connections to the last hidden layer or output layer. Finally, we complement our results by showing benign properties of the ‚Äúnear-identity regions‚Äù of deep ResNets, showing depth-independent upper bounds for the risk attained at critical points as well as the Rademacher complexity.","tags":[],"title":"Are deep ResNets provably better than linear predictors?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chulhee Yun","Suvrit Sra","Ali Jadbabaie"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575158400,"objectID":"7b0e84861db5637939c7e6c71f083eb5","permalink":"https://chulheeyun.github.io/publication/yun2019small2/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yun2019small2/","section":"publication","summary":"We study finite sample expressivity, i.e., memorization power of ReLU networks.

We also prove that width $\\Theta(\\sqrt N)$ is necessary and sufficient for memorizing $N$ data points, proving tight bounds on memorization capacity. The sufficiency result can be extended to deeper networks; we show that an $L$-layer network with $W$ parameters in the hidden layers can memorize $N$ data points if $W = \\Omega(N)$. Combined with a recent upper bound $O(W L \\log W)$ on VC dimension, our construction is nearly tight for any fixed $L$. Subsequently, we analyze memorization capacity of residual networks under a general position assumption; we prove results that substantially reduce the known requirement of $N$ hidden nodes.

By exploiting polyhedral geometry, we reduce the total computation down to one convex quadratic program (QP) for each hidden node, $O(M)$ (in)equality tests, and one (or a few) nonconvex QP. For the last QP, we show that our specific problem can be solved efficiently, in spite of nonconvexity. In the benign case, we solve one equality constrained QP, and we prove that projected gradient descent solves it exponentially fast. In the bad case, we have to solve a few more inequality constrained QPs, but we prove that the time complexity is exponential only in the number of inequality constraints.
